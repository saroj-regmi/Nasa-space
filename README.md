# Nasa-space
This is a nasa space hackathon project
Many space station trackers are available online, but they often have limited features and capabilities. For example, some are bidimensional and do not provide 3D depictions. Other trackers provide some 3D depictions but show the Station as a dot or a 2D icon instead of a 3D model. Many that do provide full 3D depictions are desktop applications and are not readily accessible via a web browser. And many trackers that are fully 3D and web-based are closed-sourceâ€”there's no way to access the code to learn how they work or to improve them.

Users would benefit from an open-source web application that tracks the space station and fully depicts the Earth, the space station orbit, and the Station itself in three dimensions.
We are trying to solve this probelm by implementing a solution that implements features which were lacking in the previous attempts
